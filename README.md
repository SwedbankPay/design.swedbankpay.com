## Installing / Getting started

The installation guides in this file is for further development of the design guide, and is not necessary if you plan to use the design guide in your project.

### Prerequisites

Design guide requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (includes npm).

### Installing

1. Open a terminal and navigate to repo root
1. `npm install`
1. `npm start`
1. Go to <http://localhost:3000>
1. Works? If not, contact us on Slack ([#dev-design-guide](https://payex.slack.com/messages/C0L3W8B2S/)).
1. Get to work.

## Developing

### Built with

* [React 16.2](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Less 2.7.3](http://lesscss.org/)

### Setting up Dev

* Running the command `npm start` starts the webpack dev server, (which is configured in `./webpack.config.js`). If any changes is made to this file, or any files directly influencing this file (i.e. any loaders or plugins) you need to restart the server.
* The script `npm start` will set the *NODE_ENV* variable to __development__, and start the dev server in development mode. If you wish to run the dev server in production-like environment run the command `npm run start:prod`.

### Building

To start building, run the command `npm run build` to start in dev-mode, or `npm run build:prod` for production-mode. This will make webpack start bundling everything and make static files in the `./dist/`-folder. It will also run through all files in `./src/` with eslint making sure all files are without errors before building. Also make sure all tests pass, or make changes to them accordingly.
> Note: This will delete all files already located in `./dist`.

## Versioning

We can maybe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning.

## Tests

1. Open a terminal and navigate to repo root
1. Run the command `npm test`
    * Many of the tests are snapshot based, and runs against already created snapshots. If you need to update the snapshots due to changes run the command `npm test:update`.
    * A test coverage report is generated after running the tests. This can be found in `./coverage` or.
> Note: Snapshot testing is pretty unforgiving, so if you make __ANY__ changes to a component which already has a snapshot, the tests __WILL__ crash! So make sure to run `npm test:update` before committing.

## Code style

Coding style rules set in `./.eslintrc`.

__*Make sure to follow the syntax rules enforced by eslint.*__
