[![Swedbank Pay Design Guide][og-image]][swpdg]

## Installing / Getting started

The following guides are for further development of the Design Guide, and are
not necessary if you only plan to use the Design Guide in your project.

### Prerequisites

Design Guide requires [Node.js][nodejs] (includes npm).

### Installing

1. Open a terminal and navigate to repo root
2. `npm ci`
3. `npm start`
4. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
5. Works? If not, contact us on Slack ([`#design-guide-general`][slack] – only
   available to Swedbank Pay and PayEx employees).
6. Get to work.

### Set up Git Hooks

- Open a terminal and navigate to repo root
- Run `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`

## Developing

It is important to note that as a developer, this project supports two brands:
**Swedbank Pay** _and_ **PayEx**. [Webpack][webpack] is configured to accept a
brand flag which is used to collect different sets of theme variables.
**Swedbank Pay** is default flag. E.g. `npm start` sets the theme to
**Swedbank Pay**, while `npm run start:payex` sets the theme to … you guessed
it, **PayEx**. Check out the `package.json` file for additional scripts.

### Built with

- [React][react]
- [Less][less]

### Setting up Dev

- Running the command `npm start` starts the Webpack dev server, (which is
  configured in `~/webpack.config.js`). If any changes is made to this file, or
  any files directly influencing this file (i.e. any loaders or plugins) you
  need to restart the server.
- The script `npm start` will start the dev server in development mode. If you
  wish to run the dev server in production-like environment run the command
  `npm run start:prod`.

#### Importing components

When importing different components in the files you create, you can use
shortcuts for common paths. The shortcuts are as following:

|   Shortcut    | Description                                                                            |
| :-----------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|      `~`      | root of the project (example `import package from "~/package";`)                       |
|    `@src`     | `~/src`-folder (example `import dg from "@src/scripts";`)                              |
| `@components` | `~/src/App/components`-folder (example `import Alert from "@components/Alert";`)       |
|  `@docutils`  | `~/src/App/Documentation/utils`-folder (example `import { DocToc } from "@docutils";`) |
| `@constants`  | `~/src/constants`-folder                                                               |

The shortcuts are specified in the `~/.babelrc`-file. Specifying the
prefix-shortcuts in the `~/jsconfig.json`-file enables path intellisense for
the shortcuts (at least in VSCode).

### Building

To start building, run the command `npm run build` to start in dev-mode, or
`npm run build:prod` for production-mode. This will make webpack start bundling
everything and make static files in the `~/dist/`-folder. Also make sure all
tests pass, or make changes to them accordingly.

> Note: Running the command `npm run build:prod` will delete all files already
> located in `~/dist`.

## Versioning

Design Guide uses [semantic versioning][semver]. This means that internally,
Design Guide will use a `major.minor.patch` version number to signal what the
changes in each release surmount to. This also means both CSS and JavaScript
files are versioned in lockstep, so whenever a new version of the CSS is
released, a new version of the JavaScript will be as well.

## Tests

1. Open a terminal and navigate to repo root
2. Run the command `npm test`
    - Many of the tests are snapshot based, and runs against already created
      snapshots. If you need to update the snapshots due to changes run the
      command `npm run test:update`.
    - A test coverage report is generated after running the tests. This can be
      found in `~/coverage`.

> Note: Snapshot testing is pretty unforgiving, so if you make __ANY__ changes
> to how a component, which already has a snapshot, is rendered, the tests
> __WILL__ crash! So make sure to run `npm run test:update` before committing.

## Code style

Coding style rules are set in `~/.eslintrc` & `~/.stylelintrc`.

__*Make sure to follow the syntax rules enforced by ESLint & Stylelint.*__

## Contributing

- Bug reports: File bugs as Github [issues][issues].
- Feature suggestions: File as Github issue or discuss the feature on Slack
  ([`#design-guide-general`][slack]).
- Code contributions: Code contributions are highly encouraged, but discuss
  the feature/bugfix in an issue or on Slack before you start coding.

## Creating a release

Before merging to master to create a release, make sure you follow these steps:

1. Make sure the linting (`npm run lint`) and unit tests pass (`npm test`).
2. Update the version in `~/package.json`.
3. Make sure the changelog is correct (date and version) and only contains
   changes for the current release.
4. Update the version in the URL of the `version-badge` and `version-tag`
   at the bottom of this `README.md` file.
5. Commit the changes and create a pull request from your branch to `develop`.
6. When approved and merged, create a new pull request from `develop` to
   `master`.
7. When approved, rename the merge commit to `Release x.x.x` and merge.
8. Change branch to `master`.
9. Create and push a new tag with the new release commit.

AppVeyor will now create and deploy a release on both github and
[`design.swedbankpay.com`][swpdg].

After pushing to master, create a pull request to `develop` that deletes the
changelog content but keeps the headers.
