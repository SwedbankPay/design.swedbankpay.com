## Installing / Getting started

The installation guides in this file is for further development of the DesignGuide, and is not necessary if you plan to use the DesignGuide in your project.

### Prerequisites

DesignGuide requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (includes npm).

### Installing

1. Open a terminal and navigate to repo root
1. `npm install`
1. `npm start`
    * If encountering an error, you might need to install [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) globally. You can do this by running the command `npm i webpack-dev-server -g`.
1. Go to <http://localhost:3000>
1. Works? If not, contact us on Slack ([#dev-design-guide](https://payex.slack.com/messages/C0L3W8B2S/)).
1. Get to work.

## Developing

### Built with

* [React 16.3](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Less 2.7](http://lesscss.org/)

### Setting up Dev

* Running the command `npm start` starts the webpack dev server, (which is configured in `./webpack.config.js`). If any changes is made to this file, or any files directly influencing this file (i.e. any loaders or plugins) you need to restart the server.
* The script `npm start` will set the *NODE_ENV* variable to __development__, and start the dev server in development mode. If you wish to run the dev server in production-like environment run the command `npm run start:prod`.

### Building

To start building, run the command `npm run build` to start in dev-mode, or `npm run build:prod` for production-mode. This will make webpack start bundling everything and make static files in the `./dist/`-folder. It will also run through all files in `./src/` with eslint making sure all files are without errors before building. Also make sure all tests pass, or make changes to them accordingly.
> Note: This will delete all files already located in `./dist`.

## Versioning

We can maybe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning.

## Tests

1. Open a terminal and navigate to repo root
1. Run the command `npm test`
    * Many of the tests are snapshot based, and runs against already created snapshots. If you need to update the snapshots due to changes run the command `npm test:update`.
    * A test coverage report is generated after running the tests. This can be found in `./coverage` or.
> Note: Snapshot testing is pretty unforgiving, so if you make __ANY__ changes to a component which already has a snapshot, the tests __WILL__ crash! So make sure to run `npm test:update` before committing.

## Code style

Coding style rules set in `./.eslintrc` & `./.stylelintrc`.

__*Make sure to follow the syntax rules enforced by eslint & stylelint.*__
