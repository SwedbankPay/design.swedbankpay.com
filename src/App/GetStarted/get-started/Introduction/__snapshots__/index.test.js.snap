  <p>
    We want to do our best to provide top-quality components for you to use, but this is only possible with your help. If you have any suggestions for how we could potentially improve a component, please don´t hesitate to reach out. If you have questions, feedback, or want to know what’s new in the Design Guide, feel free to join us in the #design-guide-general channel on Slack.

    What is the Design Guide?
  </h2>
  <p>
    The 
    TESTBRAND
     design system consists of two parts; the Figma designs and the web Design Guide (where you are right now). The Design Guide is the ready-to-use part of the design system and the Figma design library is for designing and prototyping.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Design Guide consists of more than design. It contains all the parts of the design system that actually can be used and implemented by developers working with 
    TESTBRAND
     products.

    <h2>
      Working with the Design Guide
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Design Guide is an organically growing system that evolves with the products. Product teams can use the Design Guide for brand identity, components, guidelines, and documentation regarding accessibility, copywriting, and more. Product teams also contribute to the system by suggesting changes and improvements to already existing components and guidelines, as well as by adding completely new ones.

    <h3>
      Contributing to the system
    </h3>
    <p>
      Components and assets that can be reused in other products should be added to the system for others to use. However, some components that fulfill an isolated need for a specific product will remain local for that product only. This informational video explains the design workflow and snowflake process, and how your product team can contribute to the Design Guide:

    <h3>
      Products using the Design Guide
    </h3>
    <p>
      An interface may look right according to the Design Guide, our brand, and the design system in general, but that does not mean that it, per definition, “uses the Design Guide“. The definition of using our Design Guide is the technical implementation and using the components taken straight from the Design Guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      When an adjustment or change occurs with one of the Design Guide components, all the projects using said component will have the changes applied to their product automatically. This way, the Design Guide enables a cohesive and unified design across the organization, which saves time for everyone involved.
