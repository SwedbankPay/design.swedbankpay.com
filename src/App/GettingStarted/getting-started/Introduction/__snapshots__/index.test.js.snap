    Swedbank Pay is a sub-brand to Swedbank and a part of the “Coin family”. That means that Swedbank Pay is built on the same foundation as Swedbank and shares the same brand platform and overall guidelines. Swedbank Pay express its own identity through the logotype, yellow color, images and tonality.
  </p>
  <p>
    To build awareness we display Swedbank Pay’s name and logotype with impact. We express a distinguishing attitude through the logotype, yellow color, images and tonality – always as simple and uncomplicated as possible. Read more about the brand in the

    Using the Design Guide
  </h2>
  <p>
    Let’s clarify the definition of using the Design Guide. Just because an interface looks right according to the Design Guide, our brand and the design system in general it still doesn’t mean that it per definition “uses the Design Guide”. The definition of using our Design Guide is the technical implementation and using the components taken straight from the Design Guide. 
  </p>
  <blockquote
    className="blockquote"
  >
    <p>
      The Design Guide enables a cohesive and unified design across the organization which saves time for everyone involved. 
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    By doing so, when an adjustment or change occurs with one of the Design Guide components, all the projects which uses the said component will have the changes applied to their product automatically. This way the Design Guide enables a cohesive and unified design across the organization which saves time for everyone involved.  
  </p>
  <h3>
    Products using the Design Guide
  </h3>
  <p>
    Because there’s a difference of following the design guidelines and using the Design Guide, not all Swedbank Pay products per definition uses the Design Guide.

    What is the Design Guide?
  </h2>
  <p>
    The Swedbank Pay design system consists of two parts; the Figma designs and the web Design Guide (where you are right now). The Design Guide is the ready-to-use part of the design system and the Figma design library is for designing and prototyping.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Design Guide consists of more than design. It contains all the parts of the design system that actually can be used and implemented by developers working with Swedbank Pay products.
  </p>
  <blockquote
    className="blockquote"
  >
    <p>
      A design system is the single source of truth which groups all the elements that will allow the teams to design, realize and develop a product.
