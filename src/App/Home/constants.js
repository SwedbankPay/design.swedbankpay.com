		text: (
			<>
				<p>
					Here&apos;s a small release, focusing on some small hopefully useful
					couple of things.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>New alert variant</strong>
					<br />
					Alerts are getting a new sibling. The "feedback" variant. We're also
					updating the icon for the success variant. This is almost a breaking
					change since you need to update it manually (although if you keep
					using the old one nothing will break yet).
					<br />
					Some minor UI updates are shipped too, like the borders are getting
					rounder.
				</p>
				<p>
					Next up is about <strong>the flags</strong>
					<br />
					We used to import by default all flags provided in the assets via the
					CSS, as an easy to use way (just by adding the corresponding CSS
					class). And although this was a very convenient method to display any
					possible flag, it was also coming with a cost: each flag was loaded in
					both aspect-ratio. This taking a toll on load time (although flags are
					tiny svg).
					<br />
					Since we realize projects actually use only a few flags, we decided to
					change the default behavior. We've asked in the channel which flags
					were actually used, and we've added them to a shortlist. Those flags
					will still be available as simply as adding the correct CSS class. If
					you need one of the rarely used flags, you will then need to import
					the flags from the npm package assets. Still very easy, but not as CSS
					as a CSS class.
					<br /> This should make the loading time faster üöÄ.
				</p>
				<p>
					We should also mention we've shipped a <strong>patch release</strong>{" "}
					just a couple of days ago. Atlas icon are now shipped with the npm
					package, we do not load them from their CDN anymore (this would make
					it more resilient to CDN outages, such as the unpkg CDN outage on
					Monday).
				</p>
				<p>
					This release also comes with its set of{" "}
					<strong>chores, dependency updates</strong>.
				</p>
				<p>Yours truly</p>

				<p>Happy New Year üéâ</p>
				<p>
					We're starting the year with some mostly documentation & identity
					updates.
				</p>
				<p>
					Biggest one first: We've updated the Playbook. For the ones paying
					attention to it you'll like it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Next on the list: the zip file containing the SwedbankPay logos is
					updated with the logos fixed we've shipped in the previous minor
					release.
				</p>
				<p>
					We've also increased the browser support. We've decided to align with
					the standard used by the JS frameworks (now last 2 major versions,
					Firefox ESR, > 0,5% instead of 1%).
					<br />
					This being said, we recommend checking and adapting your support based
					on your own users stats. This change is only impacting projects
					consuming the CSS & JS straight from the CDN. If you're pulling the
					source files then the polyfilling/transpilling will only be done by
					your own build pipeline anyways.
				</p>
				<p>
					Green side UI change: checkmark circle green color on success alerts
					is updated
				</p>
				<p>And as usual, we've included several dependency updates.</p>

				<p>
					It's been a while, but here it is. A New Release (Minor Version).
					Which means there's a bit of everything. But let's start from the
					beginning, shall we?
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Togglebox (aka Toggle, or Switch)</strong>
					<br />
					The Toggle UI has been revamped and now includes a second theme
					designed for darker backgrounds.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Logo</strong>
					<br />
					The SwedbankPay logo got fixed. It might look like minor changes for
					our myopic neanderthal developer eyes, but they're actually
					significant improvements for people equiped with eagle eyes like our
					brilliant designers ü§©.
					<br />
					We‚Äôve also clarified the documentation: the recommended usage is
					through the npm package rather than linking to a hardcoded URL.
					Otherwise, changes (like this one) might leave your project out of
					date.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Green side UI updates</strong>
					<br />
					Big shoutout to our Visby team! With the awesome addition of Johanna
					Prinz (welcome, Johanna! üëã) and more contributions (thanks Simon)
					this release includes a series of enhancements on the ‚Äúgreen side of
					the force‚Äù:
					<ul>
						<li>Tables</li>
						<li>Expandables</li>
						<li>Buttons</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>And as usual, we‚Äôve included several dependency updates.</p>
				<p>
					And remember: it's not because we're not shipping as often that the DS
					is abandoned in an old castle dungeon. We're still here, with less
					time prioritized to deliver frequent big work, but our eyes and brains
					are still looking at it, with plenty of ideas to keep it up and make
					it a great thing

					will ever forget or stop longing to come back home and taking care of
					everything he left behind.
				</p>
				<p>
					That's why I could not leave for summer holidays without coming back
					by the design system and fixing some things I owe our brillant users.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dialog</strong>
					<br />
					Dialog now fails gracefully if no invoker is found (thnx Karoline for
					the heads up)
					<br />
					It can also get multiple invokers attached to it (thanks Martina for
					the feature request)
					<br />
					The styling is also more resilient through the migration from the old
					dialog syntax
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Cards</strong>
					<br />
					Cards can now use <CodeTags type="secondary" code="picture" />{" "}
					elements & <CodeTags type="secondary" code="div.illustration" /> class
					in lieu of the <CodeTags type="secondary" code="img" /> element. They
					will be styled just the same.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dropdown</strong>
					<br />
					Thanks to the help of our dear colleague Ludvik Lund, the dropdown
					initialization script can now receive a specific{" "}
					<CodeTags type="secondary" code="id" />. So you can now call the init
					script for a given dropdown and not all of the dropdowns present in
					the DOM.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Utility classes</strong>
					<br />
					Some new utility classes have been added to the list.{" "}
					<CodeTags type="secondary" code="d-{breakpoint}-grid" /> &{" "}
					<CodeTags type="secondary" code="d-{breakpoint}-inline-grid" />.

					the button gets its width shrinked. No more spinners looking like a
					rice bean.

				<p>
					Some people believe Spring is about Mari Kondo-ing. Losers*. We think
					it's Christmas all year round. That's right üéÅ üéâ.
				</p>
				<p>
					We recommend going through the release notes for a more detailed
					overview, but the main things are as follow.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Buttons</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>new icon button for Danish MitId üá©üá∞ üîê</li>
						<li>minor non-breaking UI updates (e.g. hover color, ...)</li>

							<CodeTags type="secondary" code="span.checkmark-icon" />. It will
							make life easier. We take care of you in the background. Sit back
							and relax üçπ
						</li>
						<li>new large option</li>
						<li>new subtitle option</li>
					</ul>
					Plus several minor non-breaking UI updates (e.g. hover color, etc)
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dialog</strong>.
					<br className="pt-2" />
					We now use the standard <CodeTags
						type="secondary"
						code="<dialog>"
					/>{" "}
					element. Simpler syntax, built-in A11y, less script. In one word:
					better üöÄ. Move to it as soon as you can. Life shines brighter on the
					other side üåª
					<br />
					We keep a silent support for the old dialog syntax until the next
					major release.
					<br />
					The new dialog gets all those UI freebies & options:
					<ul>
						<li>option for gray background (white is the default BG)</li>
						<li>option for dividers</li>
						<li>
							transitions on open & close (+ options to decide if it comes from
							bottom (default) or from the right)
						</li>
						<li>new backdrop color (brand-primary + blur)</li>
						<li>2 modal sizes</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

					And many more small changes, both some UI updates/fixes & some
					dependency chores.

					Goodbye, Google, and farewell to your Material Design icons. It‚Äôs not
					you, it‚Äôs us. Or no, actually it‚Äôs you. We became too cool for school.
					Takk for i dag, and take care.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our designers, equipped with their bionic eyes, have meticulously
					examined all open-source icon sets out there, scrutinizing even the
					tiniest details. They've found their grail:{" "}
					<a href="https://atlasicons.vectopus.com/">Atlas icons</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					This marks the initial step in transitioning our icons from Material
					Icons to Atlas icons, along with some custom icons when needed. Check
					out the{" "}
					<a href={`${basename}identity/iconography/`}>
						iconography documentation page
					</a>{" "}
					to kick off the migration.
				</p>
				<p>
					This first release imports Atlas icons as a font icon (via CDN). Some
					critical icons were missing from their set, so our very own
					Michelangelo and DaVinci have crafted their own versions.
					Consequently, we now have custom icons for basic UI needs (no longer
					limited to just payment cards and flags). Chevron, hamburger-menu,
					plus, minus, and more will come from custom icons.
				</p>
				<p>
					For any unanswered questions, use Slack instead of the iconography
					page.
				</p>
				<p>
					Over the next few weeks, we'll be going through all our components to
					migrate their examples. We'll also ensure that all icon systems
					(Material vs. Atlas vs. our custom swepay-icons) display
					'identically.'
				</p>
				<p>
					We'll continue to support the old Material Icons üßì for a while, until
					the next major release. However, all new work will use the new icons
					(Atlas or our custom swepay-icons).
				</p>
				<p>
					We strongly recommend you to hop on board with the migration whenever
					you find the time. It's happening. You'll probably need help from the
					designers at some point, so feel free to reach out üòâ.

				a fresh new look and improved functionality. As part of this effort, we
				have started with our{" "}
				<a href={`${basename}components/buttons`}>Button</a> and{" "}
				<a href={`${basename}components/input-field`}>Input field</a> components
				dropped in this release. From a holistic view, things will look a bit
				funky in the beginning during this migration, but fear not, everything
				will look smashing once it is finished! In addition we are using a new
				color for textual representation, moving away from the old brown and
				turning darker.
				<br />
				There are some minor breaking changes, therefore we recommend giving a
				look at the{" "}

				On the other hand, we are loosing Eskil. He&apos;s moving away to new
				adventures, becoming a professional diapers changer (a.k.a. Papa-perm
				üë∂). We&apos;re hoping the best for him and we are grateful for all the
				hard work and big smiles he has brought with him. Those are big shoes
				left to fill, but we&apos;ll make it work üí™
