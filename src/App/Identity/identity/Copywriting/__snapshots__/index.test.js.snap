    Tonality
  </h2>
  <p>
    Our tonality is the verbal communication of our Brand. Our voice. The choice of words shows our personality, and everything we write should feel like one human being talking to another human being.
  </p>
  <p>
    We express ourselves as simply and uncomplicated as possible to make our message easy to understand. It is important that our communication feels trustworthy, welcoming and friendly. We provide solutions. What we write should always be guiding our customers forward.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Brand tonality in UX writing
  </h3>
  <p>
    The brand tonality goes hand in hand with the UX Writing principles. By following the principles for UX Writing we also stay on brand. And vice versa. They are very similar. Open, simple and caring is the basis for Swedbank Pay’s communication.

      </span>
       – avoiding jargon, complex words and expressions. 
    </li>
    <li>
      <span
        className="font-weight-bold"
      >
        guiding the customer
      </span>
       – with specific CTA’s so they know what to do next.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span
        className="font-weight-bold"
      >
        showing warmth
      </span>
       – we speak with a human voice, with the person and not to them
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>
    We and you
  </h3>
  <p>
    We want customers to feel that our communication is written by human beings. To accentuate the human touch, we use “we”. This will make the message more personal and show our commitment. We address customers with “you”. This includes headlines, for example: Your contact information, your invoices etc.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Simple and guiding
  </h3>
  <p>
    Merchants and consumers want to buy and sell – they do not want to read long and complicated texts. Always write with the intended reader in mind. Brief, simple sentences ensure readability and understanding. We avoid difficult words, abbreviations, buzzwords, clichés and exaggerations. What we write should guide and help the reader to take the next step.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Positive voice

    Importance of interface writing
  </h3>
  <p>
    Words on a screen are no substitute for a real conversation, but the right choice of words will add personality and warmth. Even though our interface writing should be concise and clear we want to ensure a more personal communication and that we are perceived as easy to deal with.

    Terminology
  </h2>
  <p>
    You have probably heard a few different words being used in relation to written content. Here is a breakdown of the main ones.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Copy
  </h3>
  <p>
    Copy is defined as written content that aims to increase brand awareness and ultimately persuade a person or group to take a particular action. Quite a lot falls under this umbrella but in the context of Swedbank Pay, an example of “pure” copy is the short texts you see on the website aiming to explain and “sell” the brand/product (see Figure 1).
  </p>
  <div
    className="d-flex flex-column align-items-center"
  >
    <img
      alt="Copy text"
      className="mb-1 w-100"
      src="/TEST/img/documentation/copywriting/terminology-copy.png"
    />
    <span
      className="caption-text"
    >
      <span
        className="font-weight-bold"
      >
        Figure 1.
      </span>
       This is an example of “pure” copy text from swedbankpay.se
    </span>
  </div>
  <h3>
    Microcopy
  </h3>
  <p>
    Microcopy is all the written content you find on buttons, links, menu items, in error messages and so on. Microcopy helps the user interact with the product. It lets the user know what to do at a certain point, explains errors, builds confidence in the user when taking an action, minimizes uncertainty in hard-to-decide situations, alleviates worries and sets expectations.
  </p>
  <div
    className="d-flex flex-column align-items-center"
  >
    <img
      alt="Microcopy copy text"
      className="mb-1 w-100"
      src="/TEST/img/documentation/copywriting/terminology-microcopy.png"
    />
    <span
      className="caption-text"
    >
      <span
        className="font-weight-bold"
      >
        Figure 2.
      </span>
       This is an example of microcopy copy text.
    </span>
  </div>
  <h3>
    UX copy
  </h3>
  <p>
    UX copy consists of all interface copy in a digital product, so basically all the text you see, including headings and paragraphs with information. Microcopy is part of UX copy, but UX copy also includes longer content relevant to the usage of a digital product.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Content
  </h3>
  <p>
    Content is what you call the longer format texts, for instance the detailed presentation of a product or service, the “About us” section and blog posts.
  </p>
  <p>
    As you can see, there is some overlap between the various terms and people can at times use them interchangeably. However, keeping track of the differences is helpful to accurately define project needs.
