			A dialog remains hidden until it is triggered. Once it is open it overlays
			the website with a dark background and presents some options, usually
			confirming or cancelling an action. If you use a dialog it is assumed that
			you want to &quot;force&quot; the user to make a choice. Therefore the
			only way to close a dialog is to choose one of the presented actions or,
			if given, press the{" "}
			<i
				className="swepay-icon-close d-inline-flex"
				aria-label="close button"
			></i>{" "}
			to close the dialog.
		</p>
		<p>
			Dialog boxes consist of a header, a body and a footer. In these you can
			put whatever you want, but some basic functionality should be included in
			all dialogs. The header should contain a short descriptive text for what
			the dialog-box does. You can include an icon with class{" "}
			<CodeTags type="secondary" code=".dialog-close" /> if you wish to give
			your user a way to close the dialog box without choosing an option. The
			dialog body should contain the main content, usually just text confirming
			an action. In the footer you will find buttons to confirm or cancel the
			requested action.
