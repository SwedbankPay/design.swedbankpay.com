Because Swedbank Pay is a payment service for all, it’s extra important to think about diversity when picking images for a product. To choose a great image, reflect over the context you’re bringing the image into and check if and where the image is used in other Swedbank Pay products. If an images is strongly associated with a certain page or feature, consider using another. We strive to use a variation of the library images while also giving the image a purpose. </p>\n        <p><span className=\"font-weight-bold\">TIP</span>: Once you’ve found a picture you think might work, try it in Figma – if it doesn’t work, keep looking and try again!</p>\n    </section>\n);\n\nconst ImageSizes = () => (\n    <section>\n        <h2 id=\"image-sizes\">Image sizes</h2>\n        <p>Once you’ve found good imagery for your website, ask yourself “Are these images the right size for where I want them on my website?” Investigate what image sizes that is required for your interface, to ensure the pictures look of high quality and aren’t pixelated or stretched.</p>\n        <p>Avoid using extremely small images in places where a larger image is needed, e.g. the main banner on a landing page, as this can cause them to look blurry, out of focus, and may cut off a large part of the image. Also be careful when using extremely large images. Only small images where a smaller image is required, e.g. your sector images, as this will drastically affect page loading speed. The optimum size for page loading time is less than 2 MB. </p>\n        <p>Finally, don’t distort or wrap the images in any way.</p>\n    </section>\n);\n\nconst FocalPoints = () => (\n    <section>\n        <h2 id=\"focal-points\">Focal points and angles</h2>\n        <p>As designers and developer we have the power and responsibility to influence users behaviour.
