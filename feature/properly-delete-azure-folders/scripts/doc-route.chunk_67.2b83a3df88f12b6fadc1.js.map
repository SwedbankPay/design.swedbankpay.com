Microcopy helps the user interact with the product.\n            It lets the user know what to do at a certain point, explains errors, builds confidence in the user when taking an action,\n            minimizes uncertainty in hard-to-decide situations, alleviates worries and sets expectations.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"d-flex flex-column align-items-center\">\n            <img src={`${basename}img/documentation/copywriting/terminology-microcopy.png`} className=\"mb-1 w-100\" alt=\"Microcopy copy text\" />\n            <span className=\"caption-text\"><span className=\"font-weight-bold\">Figure 2.</span> This is an example of microcopy copy text.</span>\n        </div>\n\n        <h3>UX copy</h3>\n        <p>\n            UX copy consists of all interface copy in a digital product, so basically all the text you see, including headings and paragraphs with information.\n            Microcopy is part of UX copy, but UX copy also includes longer content relevant to the usage of a digital product.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3>Content</h3>\n        <p>\n            Content is what you call the longer format texts, for instance the detailed presentation of a product or service, the “About us” section and blog posts.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            As you can see, there is some overlap between the various terms and people can at times use them interchangeably.\n            However, keeping track of the differences is helpful to accurately define project needs.\n        </p>\n    </section>\n);\n\nconst Tonality = () => (\n    <section>\n        <h2 id=\"tonality\">Tonality</h2>\n        <p>\n            Our tonality is the verbal communication of our Brand.

It is important that our communication feels trustworthy,\n            welcoming and friendly. We provide solutions.

To accentuate the human touch, we use “we”.\n            This will make the message more personal and show our commitment. We address customers with “you”. This includes headlines,\n            for example: Your contact information, your invoices etc.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3>Simple and guiding</h3>\n        <p>\n            Merchants and consumers want to buy and sell – they do not want to read long and complicated texts.\n            Always write with the intended reader in mind.
