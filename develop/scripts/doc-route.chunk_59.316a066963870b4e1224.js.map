A flexible 8-point spacing system means we use multiples of 8 most of the times. This not only creates consistency across all our digital products but also makes it easier for developers to know what values they should use. You can learn more about how it works under the <Link to=\"/identity/spacing\">Spacing section</Link>. </p>\n    </section>\n);\nconst Contributing = () => (\n    <section>\n        <h2 id=\"contributing\">Contributing</h2>\n        <p>When working on the different products across our brand it is important for you as a designer to understand how you can contribute to the Design Guide. It is equally important to understand which types of components can be added to the design guide and which ones are designed specific for your product. In general, the best practice is to keep a close dialogue with the design guide team and its designers and they will guide you through the process.</p>\n\n        <p>As we all know, sometimes you face niche problems which requires specific solutions, this is normal and something that we have accounted for.
