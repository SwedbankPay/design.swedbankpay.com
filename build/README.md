# Root redirect files

On a new release, the documents in this folder are placed at the root of their respective Azure containers and exist as redirectors to the newest release of the Design Guide.

For instance: If 7.1.0 is the latest release and a user navigates to the root of the domain, let's say `design.swedbankpay.com`, this user will then be redirected to `design.swedbankpay.com/v/7.1.0/`
